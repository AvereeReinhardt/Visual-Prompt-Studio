**Visual prompt studio phase 1.2**
**Prompt** Create a highly realistic oil painting on canvas in the style of early 20th-century Surrealism. The composition is simple and centered: a single tobacco pipe floats against a smooth, warm beige background. The pipe is rendered in careful detail with smooth contour lines and soft blended shading. The bowl is rounded and organic, with a slightly flattened base and a dark circular opening at the top. The stem curves gently upward and to the right in a long, elegant arc, becoming thinner toward the mouthpiece. Use subtle directional light from the upper left, creating gradual value transitions and a mild chiaroscuro effect. Highlights should appear along the upper left edge of the bowl and stem, while deeper browns and near-black tones define the underside, giving the illusion of volume and mass. Avoid visible brushstrokes, hatching, or texture—keep the surface smooth and controlled.
